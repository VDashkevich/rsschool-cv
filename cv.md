## Summary:

I started my career as a marketing manager. While working, I understood that it was interesting for me to develop and receive additional education in various fields. So I graduated as a lawyer, and at work I was promoted to the position of project manager. 
I was always interested in the field of `IT` with approach to business, so I decided to change my life and start a career in the field of `Front-end developer`.I am interested in sports, music, social projects, brands, economy of different countries and now also front end development.
I am confident that I will achieve my goals.
